<h1>Best movies according to Daniel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Star Wars 3</h3>
<p>
    Great movie that sets up the following trilogy. <br />
    Has a much darker tone and perfectly acts as a prequel. <br />
</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>
    Long movie that has beautiful worldbuilding and a great journey. <br />
</p>
<h3>The Hobbit</h3>
<p>
    The movies being done years after the LOTR counterpart, they greatly recapture what made the previous trilogy great whilst also adding their own new elements to the story.<br />
